# Text2Image using CLIP Model and Stable Diffusion model

1.Setup Environment:
Install necessary libraries and tools, including Kaggle API for dataset access, and required Python packages such as transformers, torch, diffusers, and others.

2.Download Dataset:
Use Kaggle API to download the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images and their corresponding textual captions.
Unzip the dataset to access image files and caption information.

3.Load and Process Captions:
Load the captions from a CSV file (captions.txt) into a pandas DataFrame.
Clean the image names for easier access (removing any extraneous characters).

4.Load CLIP Model: 
Utilize the CLIP model from OpenAI to convert text captions into embeddings. This model helps in understanding the relationship between images and text.

5.Convert Text to Embeddings:
Create a function (text_to_embedding) to convert text captions into embeddings using the CLIP model.

6.Load Stable Diffusion Model:
Load the Stable Diffusion model from Hugging Face to generate images based on the text embeddings.
Authenticate using Hugging Face API tokens to access the model.

7.Generate Image from Text Prompt:
Use a specific text prompt to generate an image using the Stable Diffusion model.

8.Display the Generated Image:
Use IPython to visualize the generated image in the notebook.
